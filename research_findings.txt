*(Information gathering severely limited by the inability to access Kyungil University's website and specific Gyeongsan local information sites.)*

*   **Travel Destinations Near Kyungil University (Parks, Cultural Sites, Entertainment Venues):**
    *   Without access to more localized Gyeongsan information or details about Kyungil University's specific location within Gyeongsan, providing a targeted list of nearby destinations is not possible.

    *   This information typically requires access to local blogs, student forums, or university-area guides, which were not found or accessible.

**Summary of Limitations:**
The research was significantly hampered by:
1.  `robots.txt` directives preventing access to key official websites (TripAdvisor, Kyungil University, Gyeongsan City Government).
2.  The `view_text_website` tool's limitations with JavaScript-heavy sites or sites requiring interactive navigation (like dropdown menus for region selection on VisitKorea).
3.  Failures in using the search functionality of some websites (e.g., VisitKorea returning 404s for search queries).
4.  Inability to perform broad, exploratory web searches to discover independent blogs or alternative news sources not already known.

The information compiled reflects what was accessible under these constraints.
