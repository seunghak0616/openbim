## 2. Branding Elements (Suggestions)

*   **Color Palette:**

    *   **Primary Color:**
        *   `#28A7E9` (Vibrant Blue): Modern, trustworthy, associated with innovation and youth. Could be used for calls to action, links, and key headings.
    *   **Secondary Colors:**
        *   `#FFFFFF` (White): For backgrounds, providing a clean and spacious feel.
        *   `#F4F4F4` (Light Gray): For subtle background variations or card elements.
        *   `#333333` (Dark Gray/Off-Black): For body text, ensuring high readability.

### 3.1. Homepage

*   **Hero Section:**
    *   Full-width banner image (or a subtle auto-playing slider with 2-3 images: `placeholder_gyeongsan_hero_1.jpg`, `placeholder_campus_life_1.jpg`).
    *   Text overlay: "Discover Gyeongsan: Tradition, Innovation, and a Touch of Romance." (Large, engaging font - Montserrat).

    *   Button: "Explore Now!" (Primary color: `#28A7E9`).
*   **Introduction (Website Purpose):**
    *   Clean text block directly below the hero, using body font (Open Sans).
*   **Featured Sections (Grid/Card Layout):**

## 4. Navigation

*   **Main Navigation Bar (Header):**
    *   Position: Top of the page, sticky if possible for easy access.
    *   Logo: (Placeholder for "Gyeongsan Explorer & KIU Design Hub" logo - simple text logo initially).
    *   Links:
        *   Home
        *   Gyeongsan Attractions
        *   Food & Restaurants
        *   Dating Courses
        *   Kyungil Design Dept.
    *   Style: Clean, readable font (Open Sans or Montserrat). Current page highlighted.
*   **Footer Navigation:**
    *   Simple, at the bottom of each page.
    *   Content:
        *   Copyright Â© [Current Year] Gyeongsan & KIU Design Hub (or similar).
        *   Contact: [Placeholder email, e.g., `info@gyeongsan-kiu-promo.com`]
        *   Social Media Icons (Placeholders for Facebook, Instagram, YouTube - links to generic Kyungil University or Gyeongsan tourism pages if they exist and are found later, otherwise just icons).
        *   Privacy Policy / Terms of Use (Placeholder links).

## 5. Image Usage

*   **Emphasis on High-Quality:** All images, including placeholders, should be clear, well-composed, and relevant to the content they represent.
*   **Placeholder Strategy:**
    *   Use the listed placeholder images thoughtfully within their respective sections as described in section 3.
    *   Ensure consistency in image aspect ratios within grids if possible (e.g., all cards in a grid use 16:9 or 4:3 images).
*   **Future-Proofing:** Design should allow for easy replacement of placeholders with actual, specific images of Gyeongsan, Kyungil University, food, etc., once available.
*   **Alt Text:** (Implementation detail for HTML) All images must have descriptive alt text for accessibility. For placeholders, alt text like "Placeholder image for Gyeongsan historical attraction" is acceptable.

This design specification document provides a foundational blueprint. Actual UI mockups and iterative design would refine these concepts further.
